# Dicereum Project

Dicereum is a collaborative worldbuilding project which explores the fictional world of Dicereum. In this project, we create countries as well as the cultures, institutions, and histories that guide them.

This organization hosts our website code for now, however we may have more to add here in the future.

## Help Us

At the moment Dicereum is a four-man crew and lore development is basically happening at a snail's pace. If you'd like to contribute, get in touch with one of us.

“The mind that thought of light, heavy, grey, yellow, still, swift, also conceived of magic that would make heavy things light and be able to fly, turn grey lead into yellow gold, and the still rock into a swift water.”
